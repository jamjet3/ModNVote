# ModNVote

**Modern, transparent community voting for PaperMC 1.21.x**

A privacy-first, lightweight, and production-ready **yes/no voting plugin** for Minecraft servers — designed for modern communities that value fairness, trust, and data integrity.  
ModNVote is built by [**MODN METL LTD**](https://modnmetl.com) and open-sourced to promote transparent community decision-making.

## ✨ Features

- `/modnvote yes` or `/modnvote no` — anonymous voting (1 per UUID).
- `/modnvote status` — displays live YES/NO tallies.
- `/modnvote verify` — cryptographically validates vote integrity.
- `/modnvote audit` — shows how many votes came from bypass-permitted users.
- `/modnvote fullaudit` — groups voters by IP to check for irregularities (no vote disclosure).
- `/modnvote reset` — admin command to clear all votes.
- `/modnvote reload` — reloads configuration without restarting the server.
- **IP-based duplicate prevention** with configurable bypass permission.
- **SQLite persistence** for reliability and restart safety.
- **Integrity hashing** ensures tallies cannot be silently altered.
- **PlaceholderAPI support** for scoreboard and UI integration.

> ModNVote is a successor to the PineVote plugin, rebuilt for broader use under the MODN METL brand.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Default excerpt from `config.yml`:

```yaml
permissions:
  bypass_node: modnvote.bypass  # or use your existing alt-protection node (e.g. noaltsexploit.bypass)

logging:
  audit_votes_to_console: true   # Logs when a vote is recorded (never reveals who voted for what)
  audit_bypass_to_console: true  # Logs bypass usage (without disclosing vote choice)
```

> 🧠 ModNVote never logs **what** a player voted — only that a valid vote was recorded.  
> This keeps your voting process auditable yet fully private.

## 🧭 Roadmap

- [ ] MySQL database support for large networks
- [ ] Configurable voting periods with automatic start/end
- [ ] Player login reminders about active votes
- [ ] Admin confirmation before vote resets
- [ ] `/modnvote stop` command to end voting early (without wiping results)
- [ ] Multi-question polls and rich voting UIs
